Volleyball Hitting
Attacking the ball is all about timing and precision. The goal of the third hit, or spike, is to make the ball difficult for the opposing team to return. The approach for a front-row attack starts several feet behind the 10-foot line. You should be in an athletic position with your knees and hips flexed; your feet should be about shoulder-width apart, and all your weight should be on the balls of your feet.
