Volleyball Passing
Bring your arms together straight and away from the body. Your forearms should create a “platform,” where the ball should contact. Do not use your fists or wrists to hit the ball—the contact should be about two to six inches above the wrists. Do not swing your arms; just let the ball make contact.
