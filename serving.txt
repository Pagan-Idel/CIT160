VolleyBall Serving
A toss before the game gives the winner a chance to choose whether his team will serve or receive first. When the team that served the ball loses the rally the other team gets possession of the ball. If the person serving the ball steps into the court or on the line before she hits the ball, the team loses the serve. If the server threw the ball, she can let it drop and take another toss only one time per rotation. When a serve hits the top of the net and crosses to the opposing team’s side it is considered good.
