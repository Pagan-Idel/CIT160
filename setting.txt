Volleyball Setting
Start in the ready position facing the target. Spread fingers in the shape of the ball above the head. Form a triangle with thumbs and pointerfingers (hands should not be touching). Place hands directly in front of the face close to the forehead. This position is called NEUTRAL and is always the starting position for the set. On contact, set by extending the arms and legs.
